In order to run this, you'll need to have installed:
- Haskell's Cabal (required minimal version specified in `terminal-snake.cabal`, perhaps the easiest way to install is by using [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)).
- Ncurses devel bindings (e.g. `sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev` on Ubuntu, `sudo dnf install ncurses-devel` on Fedora).

In order to play, run `cabal run`.
